### Game: Fetch
In Fetch, you play as a human, trying to guide their dog through a series of puzzles from the other side of a fence. 
By shouting commands via text-entry, you can coerce the dog into doing what you want it to, 
but the degree of seperation in the controls can make that more challenging than it first appears.
Fetch was made for the GMTK 2021 Game Jam
